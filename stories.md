### Stories <a name="stories"></a>###

##### General <a name="storiesgeneral"></a>#####
Product Backlog contains all possible items for the sprint, even if they will not be completed during this period.

##### Adding stories <a name="addingstories"></a>#####
All members of the development team, including members of the marketing & sales team, are allowed (and encouraged) to add their own stories.
They will then be the __requester__ (and thereafter __accepters__) of the story and responsible for adding __a clear description__ and a __screenshot, if applicable__.
All new stories will be added to the icebox.

Members of the dev team can assign ownership of the ticket themselves and, if they are able, should __add sufficient tasks__ to the story as well.
This is to better communicate to themselves or another member of the team what the story actually entails regarding terms for acceptance, specific requirements or a list of abilities.
Other members of the team can leave the ownership blank. Upon scheduling the story, the scrum-master will assign an owner to the story.

##### Scheduling stories <a name="schedulingstories"></a>#####
The scrum-master, having consulted with the product owner, will put all stories for the coming sprint in the backlog on friday.
Only the scrum-master is allowed to schedule stories.

##### Accepting/Denying stories <a name="aodstories"></a>#####
Only requesters of the story are allowed to accept or deny a story.
This is to prevent miscommunication and to ensure that the requester has seen the desired results.

On some occasions, the scrum-master will be allowed to accept or deny stories, in communication with the requester and clear understanding of the story.

##### Pricing <a name="takingownership"></a>#####
The scrum-master is in charge of [assigning points to each story](#points). If however the scrum-master doesn't feel confident in assigning points to a story, he will consult a member of the team.

### Points <a name="points"></a>###

We use a linear point system that looks this:
* __0 points:__ Quick fixes or implementations, everything from 1 minute to 15 minutes
* __1 points:__ Quick fixes or implementations, everything from 15 minutes to 1 hour
* __2 points:__ Small features, something that will take a couple of hours
* __3 points:__ Medium features, somethat that could take half a day
* __5 points:__ Large features, features where it's unsure how much time will be needed, but a medium-to-long time regardless
* __8 points:__ Extra Large, risky features where it's unsure how much time will be needed, but a long time regardless

It's important to note that the points do not have a direct link to time, but rather effort.

### Development <a name="development"></a>###

##### Choosing stories <a name="choosingstories"></a>#####
In order to meet planning and work towards a common goal, developers are discouraged to add and then start their own stories.
They should focus on the stories in the backlog, rather than adding or working on other stories.

However, there are exceptions. If the need is dire, ask the scrum-master about the proper course of action.

##### Prioritisation <a name="prioritisation"></a>#####
The priority of the story is decided by the product owner and will be labeled with a priority tag.
All other stories have equal priority. Of course all stories in the backlog have priority over those in the icebox.
