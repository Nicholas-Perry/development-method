### Velocity <a name="velocity"></a>###

Velocity calculation is kept simple: The amount of points the team delivers during a sprint.
The average velocity will be calculated by the total number of points delivered, divided by the amount of sprints it took.

The scrum-master uses the average velocity to plan in the stories for the next week and to be able to assess delivery of future features - either to customers and partners or internally.
